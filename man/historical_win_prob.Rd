\title{Compute Historical Pairwise Win Probabilities}
\usage{
historical_win_prob(ratings_history_obj, pair_adv_mat_history_obj = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ratings_history_obj}{A list of dataframes. Each dataframe should have at least
two columns: the first column contains player names and
the second column contains their ratings at a given time point.}

\item{pair_adv_mat_history_obj}{Optional. A list of matrices of pairwise advantages,
corresponding to each time point in \code{ratings_history_obj}.
If \code{NULL}, pairwise advantage is assumed zero.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of dimensions (time points × player pairs). Each column corresponds
to a unique player pair in the format \code{"player_i_vs_player_j"}, and each row corresponds
to a time point. Each element is the predicted probability that player_i defeats player_j
at that time point.
}
\description{
Calculates the predicted win probabilities for every unique pair of players
across a series of rating snapshots. Optionally incorporates pairwise advantages
(PELO) if provided.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item The function computes probabilities for all unique player pairs using the PELO formula:
\code{winning_prob_pelo(r_i, r_j, adv_ij)}.
\item If \code{pair_adv_mat_history_obj} is \code{NULL}, pairwise advantage is set to zero for all pairs.
\item To avoid combinatorial explosion, the function stops if the number of player pairs exceeds 100.
