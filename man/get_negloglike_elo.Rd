\title{Negative Log-Likelihood for Elo Ratings}
\usage{
get_negloglike_elo(K_guess, data, current_ratings)
}
\arguments{
\item{K_guess}{Numeric, the Elo K-factor to evaluate.}

\item{data}{A dataframe of match results with columns: \code{Time}, \code{A}, \code{B}, \code{match_result}.
\code{match_result} must be binary: 1 if player A won, 0 if player B won.}

\item{current_ratings}{A dataframe with columns \code{Player} and \code{Ratings} containing
the current ratings of all players.}
}
\value{
Numeric, the negative log-likelihood of the match outcomes given the current ratings
and the K-factor.
}
\description{
Computes the negative log-likelihood of a set of Elo ratings given observed match outcomes.
This function is intended for use in optimization to estimate the best Elo K-factor.
}
\details{
The function loops over all matches, computes the predicted probability of the observed
outcome based on the Elo formula, updates player ratings sequentially, and accumulates
the log-likelihood. A minimum probability of 1e-6 is used to prevent numerical issues
with log(0).
}
\examples{
# Suppose df contains match data and ratings contains current ratings
# get_negloglike_elo(32, df, ratings)
