\title{Generate Player ID Mapping from the given dataset}
\usage{
get_player_id_mapping(df)
}

}
\value{
A dataframe with two columns:
\describe{
\item{Names}{Character vector of unique player names sorted alphabetically.}
\item{ID}{Integer IDs assigned sequentially starting from 1.}
}
}

df <- data.frame(
  Time = 1:3,
  A = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),
  B = c("Bob", "Charlie", "Alice"),
